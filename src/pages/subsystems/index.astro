							Our CubeSat follows a modular architecture with six primary subsystems working in concert to perform mission operations. Each subsystem is designed and developed by a dedicated team of students and faculty members with expertise in the relevant field.
						</p>
						<p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground">
							The subsystems are integrated through a common data bus and power distribution system, allowing for efficient communication and resource sharing. This modular approach enables parallel development and testing of individual components while ensuring compatibility within the complete system.
